        <p><h2>Highschool student</h2></p>
        <p>I am a 16 year old highschool student who is eager learning how to code.</p>
        <p>I live in the Netherlands, in a quiet little village in the North of the land.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I'm pretty familiar with the following languages: </br> HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL</p>
        <p>My motivation is high and I am often recognised as a hard worker.
        </br> While i'm good at those things my weak point is presenting in large groups.
        </br> A better place for me is in a small group. That way i find myself more productive.</p>
